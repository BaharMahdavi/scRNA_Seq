# scRNA_Seq_Data_k-means_Clustering_in_Python
This project represents my inaugural foray in field of machine learning as a data mining master's student during the fall semester of 2022-2023. This is my initial exploration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data analysis using k-means clustering in Python. :)
